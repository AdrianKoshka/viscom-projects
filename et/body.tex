\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
Typefaces are a crucial part of everyday life. While most people don't even think
about typefaces, they can make or break something. Whether it be a piece of 
advertisement, the user interface (UI) of a program, or a simple flyer for a
neighborhood event, typefaces can have a great effect on how something is
perceived.

\subsection{What exactly is a typeface?}
\paragraph{}
In the previous paragraph, you probably noticed the use of the word ``typefaces''
instead of the word ``fonts''. You're probably wondering what the difference is
between a ``typeface'', and a ``font'' is. I stumbled upon this explanation of
``typeface'' vs. ``font''.

\begin{displayquote}
	A typeface is a family of fonts (very often by the same designer). within a
	typeface there will be fonts of varying weights or other variants. E.g.,
	light, bold, semi-bold, condensed, italic, etc. Each such variation is a
	different font. The only evolution is terminology that results from the
	transition from metal-cast to digital fonts is that (point) size is no
	longer fixed. \cite{jontan2008}
\end{displayquote}

To boil it down further, a typeface is a family of fonts, each font within the
typeface having a unique characteristic to it.

\subsection{What is this paper about?}
\paragraph{}
This paper aims to serve as a brief overview as to why some typefaces have
become commonplace, what makes a ``good'' or ``bad'', and why some have been
exiled into ridicule.

\subsection{Helvetica}
\subsubsection{A Brief Description}
\paragraph{}
Helvitica is a neo-grotesque (or, realist design) sans-serif typeface developed
in 1957, developed by Swiss typeface designer Max Meidinger. Helvetica's
ubiquitos use has led it to become a hallmark of international typography.\cite{shinuniform2017}.

Helvetica was designed post World War 2 (1957). The designer of Helvetica
Max Meidinger who had input from Eduard Hoffman wanted to design a neutral
typeface which had great clarity and no intrisic meaning.
